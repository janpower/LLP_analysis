# LLP_analysis
In this project I analysed the publicly available data for the Modellstudiengang 2.0 at Charit√© Berlin. 
The aim was to extract information about the average weekly workload of classes with compulsory attendance, and the results are graphically displayed. The work was done in python using jupyter and sqlite.
